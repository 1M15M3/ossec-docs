* `Vulnerability Management: OSSEC & Secunia PSI <http://blog.rootshell.be/2011/11/28/vulnerability-management-ossec-secunia-psi/>`_ by Xavier Mertens
  "Vulnerability Management"... This is an important topic for your corporate security. One of the steps in this process is the monitoring of your applications and operating systems. With hundreds (thousands?) of devices connected to your network, how to keep an eye on the applications and patches installed on all of them? There exists plenty of vulnerability management tools which allow you to track/install patches from a central place. But again, most small organizations don.t have the resources or budget to deploy this kind software and users have to keep your laptops/workstations up-to-date. This article will show you how to implement a basic control of your pool of Windows workstations based on Secunia PSI and OSSEC.
