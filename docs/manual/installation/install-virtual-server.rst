OSSEC Server Virtual Appliance Installation 
===========================================

The OSSEC virtual appliance is a ready to deploy system running OSSEC 2.7.1 and the OSSEC WUI (0.8 Beta).
It is packages in the Open Virtualization Format (`OVF <http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Virtualization_Format>`_). 
OVF is supported by a number of platforms including VMWare and VirtualBox.


.. note::

   The password for all accounts on this system including root, user, OSSEC Web UI, and PHPMyAdmin is "``_0SSEC_``" (that is a zero, not a capital "oh").
   The username for the OSSEC Web UI is just "``user``," and for phpMyAdmin is "``root``".
