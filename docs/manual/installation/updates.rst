OSSEC Updates
=============

Updating OSSEC is as easy as it can get. Just download the latest package and follow
the installation instructions as usual. It will detect that you already have it
installed and ask:

.. code-block:: console

    - You already have OSSEC installed. Do you want to update it? (y/n): y
    - Do you want to update the rules? (y/n): y

Just say \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d to these questions and it will update everything properly. Your local rules
and configuration options will not be modified. The same applies to the Unix or Windows
agent updates.
